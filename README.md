![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-public_domain-blue.svg)

It's recommended to provide a copy of license statement either in the form of physical file or the license statement. Common names for license file are such as `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.txt`, or `LICENSE.md`. But sometimes, somewhere in my projects, I cannot provide a copy of license statement, so I have to link to. Then, this page is created.
